# Anvil Quest

This is a game about an elf making christmas presents by smashing things on an anvil. The controls will be very simple and you will be paid for each item you complete. Mistakes in inputting the correct key combinations result in lower pay, and too many mistakes results in the item being destroyed/having to start again.

## Influences
Anvil minigame in Fable 2 - camera position and character animation (but snappier)
Tree Dude from Super Hot - speed, snappiness and simplicity
"Bits and Parts" scene from DHMIS - tone
Overcooked - bit at the top with the orders

## Challenges
Doing orders as quickly as possible - fast key combinations 
Completing a quota within a time period

## Controls
Minimal, remember to use enhanced input in Unreal
Let's start with left and right arrow keys as in Tree Dude

## Sound
One-liners as toys are created - tone is DHMIS or that episode from Futurama with robot santa and the neptunians (elves)
Lots of juice with anvil hits, successes, failures etc.
Factory sounds and sleigh-bell music that gets a bit scary as time runs out

## Tech
Unreal 5.2
